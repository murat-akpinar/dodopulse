## Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

## Installation

> **About notarization:** DodoPulse is not currently notarized by Apple. Notarization is Apple's security process that scans apps for malware before distribution. Without it, macOS may show warnings like "app is damaged" or "can't be opened". This is safe to bypass for open-source apps like DodoPulse where you can inspect the code yourself. **Fix:** Run `xattr -cr /Applications/DodoPulse.app` in Terminal, then open the app. Notarization is planned for a future release.

### Option 1: Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap dodoapps/tap
brew install --cask dodopulse
```

On first launch, right-click the app → Open → confirm. Or run: `xattr -cr /Applications/DodoPulse.app`

### Option 2: Download DMG

1. Download the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/dodoapps/dodopulse/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag DodoPulse to Applications
3. On first launch, right-click → Open → confirm (see note above about notarization)

### Option 3: Build from source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dodoapps/dodopulse.git
   cd dodopulse
   ```

2. Build the app:
   ```bash
   swiftc -O -o DodoPulse DodoPulse.swift -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework Metal
   ```

3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./DodoPulse
   ```

### Option 4: Create an app bundle (optional)

If you want DodoPulse to appear as a proper macOS app:

1. Create the app structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p DodoPulse.app/Contents/MacOS
   cp DodoPulse DodoPulse.app/Contents/MacOS/
   ```

2. Create `DodoPulse.app/Contents/Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
       <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
       <string>DodoPulse</string>
       <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
       <string>com.bluewave.dodopulse</string>
       <key>CFBundleName</key>
       <string>DodoPulse</string>
       <key>CFBundleVersion</key>
       <string>1.0</string>
       <key>LSMinimumSystemVersion</key>
       <string>12.0</string>
       <key>LSUIElement</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

3. Move to Applications (optional):
   ```bash
   mv DodoPulse.app /Applications/
   ```

### Option 5: Run with Automator

This method allows DodoPulse to run independently of Terminal, so it keeps running even after you close Terminal.

1. Build DodoPulse first (see Option 1 above)

2. Open **Automator** (search for it in Spotlight)

3. Click **New Document** and select **Application**

4. In the search bar, type "Run Shell Script" and drag it to the workflow area

5. Replace the default text with the full path to your DodoPulse binary:
   ```bash
   /path/to/dodopulse/DodoPulse
   ```
   For example, if you cloned to your home folder:
   ```bash
   ~/dodopulse/DodoPulse
   ```

6. Go to **File** > **Save** and save it as "DodoPulse" in your Applications folder

7. Double-click the saved Automator app to run DodoPulse

**Tip:** You can add DodoPulse to your Login Items to start automatically at boot:
1. Open **System Settings** > **General** > **Login Items**
2. Click **+** and select your DodoPulse Automator app

## Usage

Once running, DodoPulse appears in your menu bar showing CPU and memory usage.

- **Left-click** the menu bar item to open the detailed panel
- **Right-click** for a quick menu with settings, language selection, and quit option
- **Click** a card to open the related system app

### Changing language

1. Right-click the DodoPulse icon in the menu bar
2. Select **Language** from the menu
3. Choose your preferred language from the submenu

## Technical details

DodoPulse uses native macOS APIs for accurate metrics:

- **CPU**: `host_processor_info()` Mach API
- **Memory**: `host_statistics64()` Mach API
- **GPU**: IOKit `IOAccelerator` service
- **Network**: `getifaddrs()` for interface statistics
- **Battery**: `IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo()` from IOKit
- **Temperature/Fans**: SMC (System Management Controller) via IOKit

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request.

### Adding translations

DodoPulse supports adding new languages easily. To add a new language:

1. Add a new case to the `Language` enum
2. Add translations for all strings in the `L10n` struct
3. Submit a pull request
